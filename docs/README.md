# UMLDoclet Alfa
Doclet for the JavaDoc tool that generates UML diagrams from the code.  
Released versions can be found in the [maven central repository][maven].  

This doclet uses the analyzed information from the JavaDoc tool.
It automatically generates UML diagrams from your code as separate 
`.puml` diagrams of your classes and packages in the 
[PlantUML format](http://plantuml.com/).

## Requirements:
To use the doclet together with the JavaDoc tool, the following is required.

- JDK version 1.7 or 1.8  
  **Note:** _This version will not work from Javadoc verion 9!  
  [Version 2.x](https://github.com/talsma-ict/umldoclet) of the UML Doclet 
  is required for newer JDK versions_
- Availability of tools.jar containing the Sun JavaDoc API.
- The doclet jar or a build system that knows how to get it (see [usage](USAGE.md)).
- An installed version of [graphviz](http://plantuml.com/graphviz-dot), at least until [pure java visualization](https://github.com/talsma-ict/umldoclet/issues/51) works.

## Usage

- Please refer to [the usage page](USAGE.md) on how to use this doclet.

## Example

Please take a look at the rendered .SVG image of this doclet's
